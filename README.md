# Quiz game

There was a buzz of quiz games on the phones a while back and I wanted to create a kind of "brain training" game where you would get a number and have to drag through tiles to total the suggested number.

The app got so far to display the numbers and allow a dragging motion through tallying up but no points system or win condition. 

## Requirements

To run this app you will need a device that supports android.

## To build

You will need to open in android studio, connect your device and build the application.

## After thoughts (2021)

These types of apps definitely get people hooked into competing to be the best.

But this is not what we set out to design, not a leaderboard, but something to help the actual mind.

It turns out we hadn't really thought much through about it so abandoned it during development, but it was still a huge insight into possibilities!
